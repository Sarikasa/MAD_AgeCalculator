The provided code appears to be an Android application that calculates a person's age based on their date of birth. Here's a brief overview:

1. XML Layout (activity_main.xml): This layout defines the user interface for the app. It includes a TextView for the title, an EditText for entering the date of birth, a Button to trigger age calculation, and another TextView to display the calculated age.

2. Java Code (MainActivity.java): This is the main activity class. It initializes the UI components, listens for a button click, and calculates the age based on the entered date of birth. The `calculateAge()` method parses the date of birth, calculates the age in years, months, and days, and displays the result in the TextView.

Overall, this Android app provides a simple age calculator functionality, allowing users to input their date of birth and get their age displayed when they press the "Calculate" button.
